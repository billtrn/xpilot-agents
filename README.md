# xpilot-agents
A Project for class COM 407 Computational Intelligence (Prof. Parker) built by Bill Tran, William Mears, and Tyler Maguire). 

## Abstract
Compare the performance of X-Pilot controllers trained with Artificial Neural Network and with Fuzzy Logic when both use Genetic Algorithm to learn their parameters.

## Methods
We are going to evolve two controllers in X-Pilot, one with Neural Network and the other with Fuzzy Logic. For both approaches, we will be using Genetic Algorithm in the learning process. For the controller with the Neural Network, we will use Genetic Algorithm to learn the weights associated with the network. On the other hand, for the Fuzzy controller, Genetic Algorithm will help us learn the thresholds for the Fuzzy sets.

We plan on having the two controllers compete individually against a well-trained aggressive bot made by Cam and Nikesh to evaluate the performance. In addition, we will also have a competition between the neural network and the fuzzy controllers for head-to-head results.
